## Description of Project:
This is a real-time bus tracker. The data will be from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA)â€™s API portal.  You will be looking at a very specific route, a bus called bus one, that travels between the MIT campus and harvests, Harvard's campus.

## How to Run:
Click the "Show stops between MIT and Harvard" button to start the tracker. In the map, it will shouw you a very specific route, a bus called bus one, that travels between the MIT campus and harvests, Harvard's campus.

## Roadmap of future improvements:
We plan to add other routes as well. Eventually, we are planning to develop a sophisticated real-time bus tracker with information like bus schedules, wait times, real-time traffic, etc.
